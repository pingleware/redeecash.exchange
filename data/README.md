# RedeeCash Exchange Data

This folder will hold the entity voluntary reporting that is not offered by the SEC EDGAR system.

The directory structure top level will be the SEC assigned filer CIK followed by the SEC assigned file number and each file with a unique filename suffixed with the filing type.

## New Filing Types

Since the SEC EDGAR does not offer voluntary reporting of annual and quarterly reports for a Regulation D or A Tier 1, the following new filing report types will be created in this repository,

* Form D-Q as the voluntary quarterly reporting for a Regulation D exempt offering
* Form D-K as the voluntary annual reporting for a Regulation D exempt offering
* Form A1-Q as the voluntary quarterly reporting for a Regulation A Tier 1 offering
* Form A1-K as the voluntary annual reporting for a Regulation A Tier 1 offering

The data format will be XML

## Audit Requirements

Since these filings are voluntary for non-public companies, an audit by an independent CPA is voluntary and not required. A managerial audit is encouraged using an algorithmic auditing tool such as https://github.com/pingleware/bestbooks-auditor

## Company Reporting

A company does not need to be listed on the RedeeCash Exchange to submit reports as long as they have an active Regulation D or A Tier 1 offering on the SEC EDGAR system and is NOT a public company. There is no charge for submitting reports.

The application to assist in creating the corresponding XML file will be distributed at https://github.com/pingleware/redeecash.exchange.reorting

3. The wallet is now whitelisted as an non-accredited investor

Sending equity tokens to the new investor,

2. Set the tokens parameter to the number of shares that you need to transfer, and press the transact button

Using an independent transfer agent to conduct the token transfers,

The independent transfer agent, will use approveTransaction and transferFrom, when the transfer agent does not hold any tokens and the contract owner holds the tokens to be transfered. The independent transfer agent can use approve and transfer, after the contract owner has transferred tokens to the transfer agent wallet. The issuer (contract owner) may act as the transfer agent for it's own securities, and should file form TA-1 with the SEC.

1. This contract 0x4538b543542e72c24AF7CBD67444270Bb0548eD5, only permits the whitelisted transfer agent to transfer tokens between wallets. The owner (which is also the issuer) is whitelisted as a transfer agent.
2. Whitelist an investor
3. The whitelisted investor can invoke approve method to indicate a buy or sell, but only the transfer agent can perform the actual transfer.
4. Whitelist a wallet as an independent transfer agent
5. Switch to the investor wallet and make a requestBuy for a 100 tokens
6. Switch to the transfer agent wallet and approveTransaction using the owner wallet, the selected investor and 100 tokens
