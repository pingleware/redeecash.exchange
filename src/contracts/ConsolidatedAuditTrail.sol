/*
 * In this example, the AuditableContract smart contract has a struct named AuditTrail to store relevant data such as the user address, 
 * action performed, and the timestamp of the action. The auditTrails array is used to store the audit trail logs.
 *
 * The addAuditTrail function allows users to add an audit trail entry by providing the action as a parameter. 
 * It creates a new AuditTrail object with the sender's address, the provided action, and the current timestamp. 
 * The new entry is then added to the auditTrails array, and the AuditTrailAdded event is emitted to signal the addition of a new audit trail.
 *
 * To use this contract, deploy it to an Ethereum network, and then call the addAuditTrail function whenever you want to add an audit trail entry. 
 * The action performed can be passed as an argument to the function.
 &
 * Each time the addAuditTrail function is called, a new entry will be added to the auditTrails array, 
 * and the AuditTrailAdded event will be emitted. You can listen to this event to capture and store the audit trail logs externally.
